1) Python is an example of an
xx    Interpreted language
        Declarative language
        Operating system language
        Data science language
        Low level language

2)Data Science is a

            Branch of computer science
            Branch of artificial intelligence
xx         Interdisciplinary, made up of all of the above

3) data visualization is not part of data science
xx              false
4) Which bracketing style does Python use for tuples?

    xx            ( )
                    [ ]
5) In Python, strings are considered Mutable, and can be changed.
                False This is false
    xx        True
6) What is the result of the following code: ['a', 'b', 'c'] + [1, 2, 3]
## this is concatinating a list
    xx                ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]
                    TypeError: Cannot convert list(int) to list(str)
                    ['a1', 'b2', 'c3']
                    [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]]
7)String slicing is
                    A way to make string mutable in python
                    A way to reduce the size on disk of strings in python
        xx            A way to make a substring of a string in python

8) When you create a lambda, what type is returned? E.g. type(lambda x: x+1) returns
                        <class 'function'>
                        <class 'type'>
            xx            <class 'int'>  this is wrong
                        <class 'lambda'>

9) The epoch refers to
                        January 1, year 0
        xx              January 1, year 1970
                        January 1, year 1980
                        January 1, year 2000

10)  This code, [x**2 for x in range(10)] , is an example of a
        xx            List comprehension
                        Sequence comprehension
                        Tuple comprehension
                        List multiplication
