#LAMBDA: creates anonymous function in Python
# You declare a lambda function with the word lambda followed by a
#list of arguments, followed by a colon and then a single expression and this is
#key. There's only one expression to be evaluated in a lambda. The expression
#value is returned on execution of the lambda.
